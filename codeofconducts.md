# Code of conduct

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the staff at emailing neelknightme@gmail.com or by reaching out to one of the conference organizers on site with a staff t-shirt.

If your physical safety or the physical safety of others is at risk, please dial 911.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

 - Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Any type of racism based on geneder, color, language or nationality but not limited to this list.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference, with no refund.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event-related activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

# Usage and Content Policies: Rules for Using Meetup or Event

# Be Real

Meetup profiles are intended to represent real people in a local area. Meetup member profiles must be honest and authentic.
Be Honest: Intentions, Affiliations, Transparency

All members should be open about who they are, their intentions, and their affiliations. All Meetup group and event descriptions should be accurate, to allow members to make informed decisions about their participation.
Be Yourself: Fake Accounts & Impersonation

Creating fake accounts, malicious accounts, or accounts meant to impersonate another person, is prohibited on Meetup.
 
# Be Respectful

Respecting people's time, attention, personal choices, and personal boundaries is essential to creating safe and trusting communities. Be respectful in interactions with people and in content posted on the platform. Meetup monitors and restricts behaviors that are dishonest, undermine the integrity of the platform, violate personal boundaries, or serve to intentionally upset people.

## Message Respectfully: Don't Spam

Content sent to a member that is irrelevant, impersonal, unsolicited, promotional, or repetitive is spam.

## Set Appropriate Expectations and Honor Them: Don't Tamper with Meetups

Converting or changing events in a Meetup or a Meetup group so that they no longer align with the expectations and purpose set by the organizer and leadership team is misleading and not allowed. 

The intentions of the Meetup group should remain consistent with member expectations as set in the Meetup group description.

## Converting

Stepping up as organizer to a Meetup in order to change the focus of the Meetup, to close the Meetup, to send or post promotional content, or to send or post content not aligned with the original description of the Meetup, is prohibited. If it is your intention to change the meaning or purpose of a Meetup, we advise that you start a new Meetup instead. If a Meetup group gets a new organizer, the mission of that Meetup group should stay the same. Events in a Meetup group should reflect intentions expressed in the Meetup group description.

## Tampering

Altering the content or settings of a Meetup group without permission from the main organizer, or in a way that is not aligned with the purpose of that Meetup group, is prohibited. Any use of Meetup tools or features to disrupt the Meetup or destroy content for the purpose of undermining or undercutting the established community is a violation of our policies.

## Honor Requests for Distance: About Block and Ban Decisions

If you are blocked, you’re blocked. Members must accept and respect any organizer’s decision to ban a member from a group, or a member's decision to block a member from contacting them. Creating new accounts to circumvent block or ban decisions is prohibited.

## Sexual Content and Nudity

Pornography is not allowed on Meetup. Publicly shared photos must be appropriate for general audiences. Nude or sexual photos are not allowed in public spaces. 

## Nudity

If nudity or sexuality is part of a Meetup's identity or lifestyle, organizers must keep the group Private in order to limit access to this content to members of that group. Meetup expects leadership teams to monitor this content.

## Sex Solicitation and Prostitution

Meetup prohibits groups that, or individuals who, use Meetup to proposition for sex, or to promote or engage in prostitution. For policies on Meetup groups that may contain such content, please see Sexual Interests and Adult Interests and Identities in Meetup Group Policies.

## Shocking, Disturbing, and Violent Content

Gratuitously graphic, disgusting, obscene, or violent content is prohibited. We don't allow content posted to upset, shock, or disturb a Meetup community or its members. 

## Child Exploitation

Meetup has a zero tolerance policy regarding child pornography or anything Meetup HQ believes exploits, sexualizes, or fetishizes minors. Such content will be removed from the platform and the uploader will be banned. Meetup reports all child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).

## Ask for Permission: Consent

Meetup defines consent as welcomed communications and actions to engage with a member. Engaging with anyone in a non-consensual way is strictly prohibited. If ever in doubt, ask permission.

## Respect Privacy: Don't Post Other People's Private Information

Posting other people's private information without their explicit consent is prohibited. …

Members and organizers should always be mindful of privacy and use discretion when sharing any private content that belongs to themselves or to other members. For example, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, financial information, passwords, and government identification are considered private information.
 
# Be Kind

Bullying, harassment, exploitation, and acts of hate undermine community building in safe spaces where people can trust one another. Building real relationships requires us to be more compassionate and kinder towards one another. Meetup enforces against behaviors that are threatening, intentionally malicious, or personally harmful--physically, emotionally, or mentally.

## Be Compassionate: Don't Harass, Bully or Shame

Harassment and bullying are not allowed on Meetup. Meetup will honor requests to remove content that publicly shames or degrades a private individual. 

Members should first contact the uploader or the organizer to request that content be removed.

Harassment is persistent or non-consensual contact from another member. Bullying is the intentional posting of mean content for the purpose of hurting or embarrassing another.

Meetup will honor requests to remove nude, lewd or shaming photos if the subject of that content reports it. Content targeting a public figure, organization, or anyone who has gained news attention, is not subject to these policies.

## Act with Integrity: Do Not Manipulate or Exploit

Any attempt to use someone's insecurities or vulnerabilities for personal gain is considered manipulation or exploitation and is prohibited.

## Hate and Supremacy

Hate speech, supremacy, or behavior that incites hate or violence against individuals or groups of people based on who they are or their beliefs, is prohibited.
 
# Be Safe

All organizers and members should take ownership over their personal safety and should never put themselves or others in danger. We expect all organizers and members to be mindful of local laws when engaging with their Meetups. Where appropriate, organizers should also set guidelines for their Meetups to ensure their members are participating safely.

## No Threats, Violence, or Personal Endangerment

Using Meetup to promote, facilitate, or organize violent, criminal, or non-consensual actions that endanger anyone, physically, mentally or emotionally, is prohibited. 

Credible threats of violence or aggression will be removed and are grounds for removal.

## Self-Injury

Meetup does not allow any content that encourages or glorifies self-injury or encourages others to harm themselves.
 
# Copyright and IP

## Intellectual Property

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. Posting content that violates another party's intellectual property rights is prohibited. 

When provided with the requisite information, Meetup will remove or disable access to material that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others or remove accounts of those who may be repeat infringers. Please note that simply holding a Meetup around a similar topic in a shared location is generally not considered a violation of our policies.
