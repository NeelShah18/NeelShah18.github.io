<p style="text-align: justify;">When I completed this book, the first thought comes to my mind was "What a beautiful story telling and creative writing". A story of love, bound, relation and dream of perfect life. Don't worry I will not tell you the story. But, if you have questions such as, What is love? or What is the <span style="color:#581845;">boundary of love?</span>, then <a href="http://nicholassparks.com/"><span style="color: #FF5733;">Nicholas Sparks</span></a> beautifully narrative all that answer very beautifully. How one girl falls in love with a young boy, but her family disagrees with her choice and her family decide her marriage with someone else. What happens at last, with whom she will spend her whole life for her affection of perfect life. If that young boy is her husband or one who was selected by the family will be her husband. For me, it is a <span style="color:#581845;">rollercoaster of emotion</span>. It is must read the book.</p>
