  Hi, My name is Neel. I loved to do ML, DL and Data science. I use python, tensorflow, keras and skitlearn to develope my idea in cyber world. Most of my work is open source such as emot library, optimize python and others. I am inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Kalam(rocket man of India) and his work. Their famous quote of hid "If you want shine like sun than you have to burn like sun", always teach me to work hard but smartly.
