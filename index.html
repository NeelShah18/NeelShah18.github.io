Mostly my work is on Python, R, MongoDB, MySQL, and Java. I am an active coder at GitHub and like to open source my most codes(Please cite me when you use). I love Ubuntu as my main-OS(Sorry windows but ubuntu is a lightweight and open source!). But in free time, I like to do HTML, CSS and javascript coding.
