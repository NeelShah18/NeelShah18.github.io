<p style="text-align: justify;">When I complete the book, the first thought comes to my mind is "What a beautiful story telling and writing". A story of love, bound and relation. This story teaches <strong>meaning of love</strong>. Don't worry I will not tell you the story. But, if you have questions such as,<strong>What is love? or What is the boundary of love?</strong>. Nicholas beautifully narrative the story, how one girl falls in love with a young boy, but her family disagree with her decision and her family decide her marriage with someone else. What happens at last, with whom she will spend her whole life. If that young boy is her husband or one who was selected by the family will be her husband. For me, it is a rollercoaster of emotion. It is must read the book.</p>
