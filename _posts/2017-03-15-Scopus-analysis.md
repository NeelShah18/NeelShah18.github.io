# SCOPUS journal Data analysis of Indian Research

<p style="text-align: justify;">About: The main aim of this data analysis is to identify the ongoing research in Indian Universities and Indian Industry. It gives a basic answer about research source and trend with top authors and publication. It also shows the participation of Industry and Universities in research. Than it is compare to world's trend gathered from arxiv open source dataset.</p>

**Note: All data is related to computer science field only.**

#### Technical Implementation - Open source license

It is implemented in a Jupyter notebook with a back of Anaconda and Python 3.6+ version. 

Dataset(only arxiv data, SCOPUS dataset is not open source) and Jupyter notebook is available under MIT - open source license. If you want to use this code or data feel free to do it, But,  Please cite me.

#### About ARXIV
<p style="text-align: justify;">arXiv is an e-print service in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. Submissions to arXiv should conform to Cornell University academic standards. arXiv is owned and operated by Cornell University, a private not-for-profit educational institution. arXiv is funded by Cornell University Library, the Simons Foundation and by the member institutions.</p> [ref](https://arxiv.org/)

#### Results of data analysis:

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first pie chart shows that 14.42% research done by Industry and 85.58% research done by University. It is a little bit surprising that in India the ratio of Industry and University research is not good compared to other countries.</p> 
<img src="/images/scopus_pic/pic_1.png" width="750px" height="250px">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Second pie chart gives the information about companies research, and It is surprising that almost  70% research done by non-Indian companies headquarters in India. Google and IBM published almost 62% of total industry research publication. While there is only one Indian company who survive in top 10 is TCS with 13% publication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A country with more 129 Deemed Universities, 67 Institution of National Importance (Public), 700 Total Degree-granting Institutions, 35,539 Affiliated Colleges (Public or Private) below result create a big question on the quality of education. It is a big concern for the Indian government and Indian University. From all university publication almost 42% of research publication done by Top - 15 Universities. It is surprising that almost 7.5% of total research publication done by IIS - Banglore alone.  Even IIT - Kharagpur which knows as research hub of Indian IT sector, ranked 7th in top 15 Universities with 2.86% of publication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, there is a boom of Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and deep learning and below bar graph proves the popularity of those research from 2001 to 2016. It also shows that publication in AI field shows zig-zag patterns because of complexity in research and lake of financial support in India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When we compare that data with arxiv data which represent world's research trend, we did notmatch the world's trend.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When anlysis the top words use in title from arxiv world dataset, below chart gives a clear trend in research. And this shows, We are lacking behind that.</p>

#### About Dataset and processing and cleaning of data:

* SCOPUS data set is not open source. So we can not able to publish it.
* ARXIV meta data(Limited field such as author name, title name, summary, citation, category) is open source and dataset link is available below.
* Data is already clean and arranged.

**Dataset and Jupyter notebook is available under MIT - open source license. If you want to use this code or data feel free to do it, But,  Please cite me.**
